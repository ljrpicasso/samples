## Coding Samples from John Ribar

- anagrams.rb

	This was a ruby quiz solution. It turned out different than all the
	other solutions in our group - a faster algorithm... 
	
- sub-new

	We made use of the 'sub' utility from 37Signals for many of our 
	common functionality. However, you needed to generate a new script
	for each new command. I wrote here a command within the sub command
	to generate boilerplate for the new command to get you started.
	
- life

	Another ruby quiz solution ;-)  This is the standard life game, written
	in ruby using curses for the screen manipulation.

This is a Wordpress site, but using the Foundation css framework I was
referring to in our meeting.
